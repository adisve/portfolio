          I'm Adis Veletanlic, a Swedish software engineer, focusing on creating
          experiences worth looking at and a fan of minimalism. some of my
          biggest interests are playing (many) instruments, music, and software
          development. I'm currently studying Computer Science at HKR in Sweden
          and looking for opportunities in open-source projects.
